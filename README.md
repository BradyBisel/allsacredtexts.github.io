## ✨ Mission
All Sacred Texts is a nonprofit project dedicated to illuminating the spiritual and historical connections between sacred writings across cultures, religions, and time periods.

By blending ancient scripture with modern AI tools, we aim to:
- Uncover the shared wisdom of humanity
- Bridge traditions across continents and centuries
- Empower open inquiry, discovery, and understanding

We invite contributors from all walks of life to help rediscover the world’s spiritual DNA — together.
