    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>All Sacred Texts</strong>, a heartfelt and collaborative project dedicated to exploring the wisdom passed down through generations of sacred texts. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you‚Äôre a scholar, a seeker, or someone just beginning to explore the spiritual tapestries of our world, this site is designed to be an open and evolving resource. Here, ancient scripture meets modern tools: we‚Äôre using AI to help uncover connections, similarities, and deeper meanings that span traditions, time periods, and regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This archive is more than a repository‚Äîit‚Äôs a <strong>bridge</strong> between worldviews, cultures, and generations. We believe AI has the potential to reveal the hidden harmonies within humanity‚Äôs collective sacred literature, inviting people of all backgrounds to see how much we actually share.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Our Mission:</strong><br>
      All Sacred Texts is a nonprofit initiative committed to making ancient writings from the world‚Äôs religious and spiritual traditions freely accessible and comparable using modern AI tools. Our goal is to illuminate spiritual and historical connections across scriptures and philosophies, fostering understanding and curiosity across faiths, cultures, and centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just the beginning‚Äînew tools, translations, and collaborations will be added as this community grows. Everyone is welcome to contribute, reflect, and explore.
